I am an Undergraduate Student at the University of Manitoba in the B.Sc. Joint Honours ( Computer Science and Physics ) Program. My research interests include Machine Learning ( deep learning and neural networks ), Quantum Algorithms and near-term Quantum Information Processing. Currently, I am working at [Online Business Systems](https://www.obsglobal.com/) as a Research Analyst and Software Developer.

In deep learning, my research is focused on Recurrent Neural Networks and their real-world applications. I mostly use Keras with the TensorFlow backend to implement and test the models.

In quantum computation, I am interested in developing quantum algorithms which can run on near-term quantum processors such as the IBM Q. This academic term, I am working on researching and implementing the quantum perceptron algorithm on the IBM Q.
