# Machine Learning Resources

An exhaustive list of machine learning resources I thoroughly use for my research.

---

Self-organization is a key component of good research. As one digs deeper into a subject area, the amount of resources that can be used tend to grow very large. Therefore, in order to easily access relevant information at any given time, it is important to maintain a database of the resources used with their relevant characteristics to one's research.

The following is a list of resources that I have used in the past and am currently using for my research into applied recurrent neural networks for human activity recognition in a home-based environment.
