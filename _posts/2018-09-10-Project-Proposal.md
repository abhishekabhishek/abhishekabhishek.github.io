### Title : An analysis of computational complexity and implementation requirements of quantum graph algorithms on an Universal Quantum Computer.
### Abhishek ., 7803917

**1. Abstract**

Recent breakthroughs in Quantum Computing has enabled public access to a wide array of actual quantum hardware and simulators. With the progress to achieving "quantum supremacy" (1)(4) being accelerated by tech giants such as Google, IBM and Microsoft, the need for algorithms to exploit the "quantum effects" of the hardware has emerged rapidly. In this research effort, we explore and evaluate the implementations of graph algorithms such as TSP and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path on simulated and actual universal quantum computers, as well as determine changes to the computational complexity and runtime speedup provided by such implementations. We use IBM's Q Platform as a base for development and execution with the help of Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing framework in Python.
