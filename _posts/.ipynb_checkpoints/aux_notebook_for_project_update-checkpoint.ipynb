    "The algorithm belong to a general class of Quantum Search Algorithms and can be used to speed up searching in a unstructured database quadratically. The applications can be generalized to more than just searching unstructured databases since the algorithm uses a trick known as Quantum Amplitude Amplification which serves as a general basis to obtain quantum run-time improvements.\n",
